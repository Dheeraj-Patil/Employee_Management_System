This application will include essential features like creating, updating, retrieving, and deleting users, commonly referred to as CRUD operations. Specifically, our Employee Management application will offer the following features:

Creating a user
Updating a user
Deleting a user
Retrieving a user
Listing all users


To develop this application, we will be using various tools and technologies such as JSP 2.2+, STS/Eclipse Neon.3 IDE, JDK 1.8 or later, Apache Tomcat 9.0, JSTL 1.2.1, Servlet API 2.5, and MySQL mysql-connector-java-8.0.13.jar.

The development process will involve creating an Eclipse Dynamic Web Project, adding dependencies, structuring the project, setting up a MySQL database, and creating various files, including User.java, UserDao.java, UserServlet.java, user-list.jsp, user-form.jsp, and an error JSP page. Once completed, we will deploy and test the application.
